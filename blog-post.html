            <h3> Blog Post: Meeting with a 21st century Diogenes</h3>
            <p>by <em>The Shoreditch Socrates - 14/1/21</em></p>
            <p><br>I encountered a homeless man yesterday in an underpass he asked me for some change. As I gazed down on this man, a modern day diogenes, I was struck. It was then I remembered the teachings of Socrates. I squatted down next to him, I would've sat
                but the floor was damp and it may have been piss, hard to tell with this lot. I turned to him, with my wise voice, the one I use when I want people to quote me. I took his hand in a show of strength looked him in the eyes and said "He is the richest 
                who is content with the least." A sense of wonder came over his face, I got up having imparted a gem on him that would surely stay with him. He shouted me as I walked away, I pretended not to hear him. "Aren't you gonna give me a quid at least?" he 
                shouted as he chased me down. The undercarriage was now crowded and I had to turn out of societal expectation more than because I wanted to converse with this toothless tyrant. He grabbed me by my shoulder, spoiling my tweed jacket with his grubby 
                fingers and entrenched fingernails. "I have given you the gift of wisdom, it is worth more than any money." I said like an old wise mysterious man, you know like the ones you seen in the movies, I say brooding yeah brooding. I made sure to squint slightly 
                and look into the distance when I said it, that's 90% of being a modern philosopher. "I don't want wisdom, I want money so I can get a 4 pack." Had I felt an emotion in the last 7 years I may have come close to crying. My own pupil turned against me, my own
                personal Ides of March, but it's January, so I suppose it'd be the Ides of January. I felt the metaphysical dagger pierce my skin, even if kant didn't. Struggling to breath at the betrayal, with my last breath I grabbed him close and managed with my dying 
                breath "et Tu brute." Well I wasn't actually dying, more of a spiritual death. Anyway the encounter made me reflect, shocked by revelations I reeled away, my world in tatters. Millennia of philosophy destroyed by this man. This called for something strong, 
                I grabbed my copy of Oppenheimers -Science and the common understanding. I'd overheard from literary circles Nietzsche had been influenced by him and had been saving it for a special occasion. I got to the Poet's Corner a favourite pub in Shoreditch for the 
                literary minded folk. Thus Spoke me and I ordered a drinking fitting the circumstances, Lavender Collins. The good thing about an LC as we call it is that you get a nice smell when you drink. I sat on one of those sofas, you know the ones with the little 
                button hole things, like old-fashioned English pub style, comfier than they look. I sipped my drink, pondering the big questions posed by Oppenheimer. Science, the metaphysical, how to build an atomic bomb. Slightly off topic, id never realised they had A 
                bombs in Nietzsche's day but here we are. He recalls the phrase "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." Words spoken by the bhagavad Gita originally apparently, I wittily thought they may well have been said by the hobo from before. So amused by 
                my own wistfulness I jotted that one down in the commonplace book, I could look back on that and purr with satisfaction in some time. Maybe someone could find it some day and celebrate my genius, like Van Gogh. I went back to my drink, put the book down. </br></p>
