                <p><br>This installment sees me meet a modern day Diogenes.
                    <q>I encountered a homeless man yesterday in an underpass he asked me for some change. As I gazed down on this man, a modern day diogenes, I was struck. It was then I remembered the teachings of Socrates. I squatted down next to him, I would've sat
                    but the floor was damp and it may have been piss, hard to tell with this lot. I turned to him, with my wise voice, the one I use when I want people to quote me. I took his hand in a show of strength looked him in the eyes and said "He is the richest

                <p class="p1desc"><br></br>This installment sees a curious football hoodlum interrupt my thoughts on the weekly train ride to Eeling by calling my left foot cultured and interrupting into song. I also look at the works of Plato and find out why they named that sticky child toy with the clay after him.  </p>

                <p class="p2desc"><br></br>This installment sees me dissect the works of Marx and finally conclude that they may have been overrated and have nothing to do with philosophy but their contribution to silent cinema can't be underestimated. So why were the Russians so enamoured with the comedy quintent? I take a deep dive on their work.</p>

Cicero's most famous and most quoted passage, unfortunately it's not for its philosophical weight and instead used as a placeholder.
